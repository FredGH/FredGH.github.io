            "This research investigates the predictive information of sentiment regarding the Energy Select Sector related XLE index and of its constituents, on the index and its volatility, based on a novel robust machine learning approach. While we demonstrate that sentiment does not have any impact on any of the trend prediction scenarios investigated here related to XLE and its constituents, the sentiment’s impact on volatility predictions is significant.",
